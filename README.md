# cub3D

## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>
The assignment consisted of writing a ray casting engine, rendering a 3D environment from a 2D map. <br>
The MiniLibX library is used as an API for the graphical instructions.

I finished the project on 26/2/2020 with a grade of 115%.

## Gameplay

As a bonus assignment I chose to add the following gameplay elements to the engine:

- picking up weapons
- sound effects
- damage mechanics
- minimap and healthbar HUD
- enemy movement (basic AI)
- medkits
- boss level
