## Project

This was a project for Codam (42 Network).
The assignment consisted of writing a raycaster to render a 3D environment using the MiniLibX (MLX) library for graphical instructions. The engine is based on the original Wolfenstein 3D, and rendered from a 2D map.
I finished the project on 26 February 2020 with a grade of 115%.

## Gameplay

I chose to add the following gameplay elements to the engine; 
- picking up weapons
- sound effects
- damage mechanics
- minimap and healthbar HUD
- enemy movement (basic AI)
- medkits
- boss level
