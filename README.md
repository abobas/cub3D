Project for Codam (42 Network)

Assignment: programming a fully functional 3D game using a raycaster, inspired by the original Wolfenstein.

One of the more fun assignments as the resulting product was an actual playable game.
I managed to do most of the bonus, which added the actual gameplay elements like picking up weapons, damage mechanics, enemies with basic AI, healing by picking up medkits and a boss level.
