Project for Codam (42 Network)

Assignment: writing a game engine using a raycaster, inspired by the original Wolfenstein.

One of the more fun assignments as the resulting product was an actual playable game.
The game engine uses a raycaster to render the environment.
I have added gameplay elements like picking up weapons, sound effects, damage mechanics, a minimap, enemies with basic AI, healing by picking up medkits and a boss level.
