Project for Codam (42 Network)

- Assignment: writing a game engine using a raycaster, inspired by the original Wolfenstein
- Notes: Bonus assignment consisted of adding gameplay elements to the engine; I implemented picking up weapons, sound effects, damage mechanics, a minimap, enemy movement (basic AI), healing by picking up medkits and a boss level
- Notes: It was mandatory to use the MiniLibX library for all graphical system instructions, this unfortunately causes very limited portability
- Grade: 115%
- Date: 26 February 2020
